### What's New ?

### Introducing Real-time Updates:
Great news! The editor you use now is connected to the cloud, which means it can receive updates directly without having to reinstall the whole editor every time. It's like getting small updates from the cloud with minor data charges, and you only need to install the latest version when the editor requires a major update. This way, you can stay up-to-date with the latest features and improvements without any hassle!
